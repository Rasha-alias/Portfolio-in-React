This is my portfolio Website, my first individual assignment using React for a course in Java Script 2. The task is to create SPA Portfolio in React. 

Design:  The design is very simple and clean.

The page consist of:

•	Home Page:  profile picture with a little presentation about me.

•	About Page: Portfolio consisting of my Facebook, Github and Linkedin + inspired and motivated video + like icon. 

•	Contact Page: contact through Mail.JS (form), Telephone, address and email.

•	CV Page: Education, Employment, Language (text formulated as CV template).

•	Skills Page: programming skills (text + animation + image).

•	Github Page: my Github username + my repositories on Github. 


Portfolio page is built in React.js with help of Node.js and with HTML, CSS.

The (npm packages) I used are:
 
•	npm install react-router-dom@6 : (React Router) It enables navigation between views of different components in a React application so it makes SPA portfolio 

•	Npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3 : (React Bootstarp). The page is designed with Bootstrap for a responsive result

•	Npm install axios: Jag använde (Axios): to fetch Github file (my Githubs user-name) and to view my repositories.

•	npm install react-player: Jag använde (React Player) to display a video.

•	npm install react-icons –save: (React Icons) to display icons from React on the page.

•	npm I emailjs-com: (Email.JS): It enables the user to fill a form and submit it which will send to my Email mail. .
 
•	npm install ityped: (Ityped) It makes effect on the text.

Jag använde Google fonts genom att importera länken på font som jag vill till min CSS fil.
